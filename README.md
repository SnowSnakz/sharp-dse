# sharp-dse
SharpDSE is a C# library that provides tools for loading and editing Procyon Digital Sound Elements (DSE) related files.

It's very heavily based on the research notes compiled by psy_commando, and the people over at Project Pok√©mon.

Right now the project is still in it's early stages.
